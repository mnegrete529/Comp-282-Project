# Comp-282-Project
Implementing a binomial queue data structure to prioritize shuttle routes on the CSUN campus based on factors like passenger load, class schedules, and efficiency in order to optimize campus shuttle operations and provide an improved routing system and passenger experience.

Problem Definition:
Clearly define the problem you're trying to solve with shuttle route optimization. Consider factors such as passenger demand, shuttle capacity, time constraints, and location constraints. This will help you design an effective solution.

Data Representation:
Represent the shuttle routes and passenger requests as data structures. You might use graphs to represent routes, and for passenger requests, you can use a data structure that stores information about each request, including origin, destination, and time constraints.

Binomial Queue Design:
Implement a binomial queue data structure to manage the shuttle scheduling. Each element in the binomial queue should represent a shuttle pickup or drop-off point and include information about the location, time, and other relevant details.

Priority Function:
Define a priority function to determine the order in which shuttle stops are scheduled. The priority function can consider factors such as the time constraints of passengers, distance between stops, and shuttle capacity. The priority function should be such that it minimizes the total time or distance traveled by the shuttle while accommodating passenger requests.

Initial Queue:
Initialize the binomial queue with the initial stops based on the shuttle's route and schedule.

Iterative Process:
Use an iterative process to build and optimize the shuttle routes. Here's a high-level algorithm:

Dequeue the highest-priority stop from the binomial queue.
Check if adding this stop to the current route is feasible without violating constraints (e.g., capacity, time). If feasible, add it to the route.
Update the binomial queue with new stops created by adding or removing passengers at this stop.
Repeat until the queue is empty or no more improvements can be made.
Constraint Handling:
Ensure that you handle constraints effectively. For example, if the shuttle is at maximum capacity, you may need to delay or reject some passenger requests.

Optimization Criteria:
Continuously monitor and optimize the shuttle routes based on your defined criteria, such as minimizing travel time, distance, or the number of stops.

Simulation and Testing:
Implement a simulation to test your shuttle route optimization system using historical data or generated scenarios. This will help you assess the effectiveness of your strategy.

Fine-Tuning:
Refine your priority function and strategy based on the results of your simulation and real-world testing.

Deployment:
Deploy your optimized shuttle route system in a real-world environment, ensuring that it interfaces with scheduling and tracking tools to manage the shuttle operations efficiently.
